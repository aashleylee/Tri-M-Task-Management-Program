# Tri-M-Task-Management-Program
## Background
The client of this project was the president of Tri-M Music Honor Society, whose role was to oversee and manage club members’ work and progress. Each of the events requires responsibilities to plan and execute them. The Honor Society is structured to be divided into separate departments: Stage Management, Public Relations, and Communications. This way, each member and corresponding executive of the department can focus on their specialized roles for each event. 

This system seemed efficient at first, but unfortunately, my client identified an issue in the lack of structure and organization – especially in managing each member’s work and progress when assigned a job. For instance, there were multiple instances where the member wasn’t aware of their work due to miscommunication. Furthermore, there were situations where the members did not keep up with
their work and could not get it done on time. 

Thus, the main issue was a lack of a system to keep track of the tasks of the members and execs. The client hoped for a system to fix this lack of organization so that they can better track each member’s responsibilities. This way, tasks and responsibilities can be managed efficiently, reducing the errors and potential problems when planning events.

## Solution: 
A Task management program to keep track of each member and executive’s progress when planning an event. The program will allow executives
(there are 5 in total: President, Vice President, Stage Management Exec, PR Exec, and Communications Exec) to assign tasks to members, who will then be able to see the tasks they are assigned and execute them before the due date. 

The client wanted to only give access to the execs to the ‘Add new tasks’ and ‘Mark tasks as completed’ functions so that each executive can make sure the tasks are fully completed before marking them as complete. The program requires members and executives to make an account and sign- in to their corresponding roles (Member/Exec) because there are functions that only executives can access, and members cannot.
